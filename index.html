<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:100%;">HEROs is an organization here at the University of Georgia that works with many kids infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. It provides care and raises money for children to help them through the challenges that they face. </p> 
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:100%;">Many kids in the program have experienced feelings of sadness, confusion, anger, or even a loss of hope. Our job in HEROs is to change that outlook and give them a new found hope. We raise money for programs that help these children with HIV/AIDS and bring awareness to the community about the struggle these children face in their everyday lives. </p>
<p style="font-family:georgia;font-size:100%;">To get involved on campus it is very easy. You can go online to ugaheros.org and join a team. All you have to do is fill out an application and request to join a team. Once on a team, you go to meetings once a week and can attend as many fundraisers as you want. It's an easy way to get involved and stand up for a good cause. It isn't time consuming, you meet a ton of new people, and you're representing children that need our help. Join UGA HEROs today!</p>
